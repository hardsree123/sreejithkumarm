        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Currently working in Industry 4.0 technologies and previously with Intelligent Transportation System. I am passionate about automation technologies and machine intelligence.
          I strive to develop softwares that are plug and play for end user and the engineers that maintain my software. I work on every assignment considering it as an opportunity for me to evolve, learn and modernize.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being continuously agile, adapt to changes, learn and teach others, learn from others and be the best for everyone around. Strive to get things right artfuly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aim is not being obsolete and never let technology dictate my limitations or the application i build.
